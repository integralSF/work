# SOME TOOLS

## 0) construction

when you open the folder, you can see the construction.

## 1) introduce

you can use:

```
python CD.py
```

to calculate the chamfer distance.

---
calulate two points cloud the different points:
```
python DIFF.py
```
---
down-sampling:
```
python FPS.py
```
---
normalization:
```
python NORMALIZE.py
```
---
for my own dataset, i will use:
```
python pipeline_process_dateset.py
```
to process the sigle dataset from start to end.

---
up-sampleing:
```
python UPSAMPLE.py
```
---
if you want to visualize by using open3d:
```
python Visualize.py
```

## 2) Additional instructions
All these are using for my own dataset.If it's just a simple copy, it's likely not working.
But my code can give you some enlighten.
